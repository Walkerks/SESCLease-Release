This branch of SESC has been modified to support Hardware Transactional Memory and a multicore system with a
Network-on-Chip simualated by booksim. It MIPS binaries built against Linux 2.6.16.

When building SESC, you can create either the ``SMP'' version, which is a bus-based multicore system, or the ``CMP''
version, which connects the cores by an NOC (i.e. 2D mesh).

For the SMP version,
$ mkdir build.smp
$ cd build.smp
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
$ make

For the CMP version,
$ mkdir build.cmp
$ cd build.cmp
$ cmake -DCMP=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../src
$ make

To run either version, you can use the scripts/local-?mp-stamp-sim.sh scripts to run STAMP benchmarks.
